    1. The characteristics of the Data, the categories of individuals whose data is being processed, and the duration and objectives of the processing are as follows, unless otherwise explicitly stated in the Framework Agreement:

        1. **Data type:** The processed Data includes personal master data, communication data (e.g. email, chat), registration data, documents, and other data in electronic format that the Processor processes for the Controller in connection with the main contractual services. The Controller assures that no data that requires special protection will be transferred for processing without prior agreement.

        1. **Categorization of data subjects:** Employees, customers, suppliers, and any other individuals associated with the data controller whose data the Controller transmits to the Processor under the Framework Agreement.

        1. **Duration and purpose:** The duration of this DPA is defined by the duration of the Framework Agreement. The purpose is restricted to the provision of services under the Framework Agreement.

    1. This DPA applies solely to the processing of Data by the Processor and its subcontractors. If the Customer hires the Processor to process Data on infrastructure or with software from third parties, the Customer is accountable for ensuring that this third party complies with data protection regulations.

1. **Responsibilities of Data Controller**

    1. The Controller bears sole responsibility for complying with data protection laws, including ensuring the legality of data transfers to the Processor and the legality of data processing and instructions under the GDPR.
    1. The Processor shall process Data only for the purposes of the Framework Agreement and in accordance with documented instructions from the Controller. All instructions must be in writing or electronic form. Oral instructions must be confirmed in writing or text immediately.
    1. If the Processor believes that an instruction violates applicable laws, it shall promptly notify the Controller. The Processor may suspend implementation of the instruction until it has been confirmed or amended by the Controller.
    1. If Data are processed according to legal provisions and contrary to Controller instructions, the Processor must inform the Controller in advance of the processing operation and the lawfulness of processing, except when contrary to an important public interest. The Controller is accountable for evaluating the lawfulness of the Data processing and ensuring the rights of the data subjects are protected. The Controller ensures that the processing of the Data by the Processor, in accordance with this DPA and the instructions, does not contravene any applicable legal provisions.
    1. The Controller must promptly inform the Processor if it detects any errors or irregularities while reviewing the order processing.
    1. The Controller is obligated to maintain the confidentiality of any knowledge of the Processor's trade secrets obtained within the contractual relationship.
    1. The Controller is required to document their instructions to the Processor.

1. **Measures to Improve Data Protection**

    1. The Data Processor shall ensure that all authorized persons who process the Data, such as employees and subcontractors, have agreed in writing to maintain confidentiality and security, or are subject to an appropriate legal obligation of confidentiality and security.
    1. The Processor shall design their internal organization to meet the specific data protection requirements within their area of responsibility. They must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and capacity of the systems and services for long-term processing in compliance with GDPR requirements.
    1. The Controller is responsible for ensuring that the technical and organizational measures implemented by the Processor provide adequate protection for the risks associated with processing the Data. The Controller is also aware of the current technical and organizational measures and the procedure for reviewing, assessing, and evaluating their effectiveness.
    1. The Processor may adjust the measures during the contractual relationship due to technical and organizational developments, provided there is no compromise on agreed-upon standards.

1. **Subcontracting**

    Prior written consent of the Controller is required for awarding contracts with subcontractors for processing Personal Data covered by the contract.

    The Controller grants the Processor general authorization to use subcontractors in accordance with the provisions of this DPA. The Processor shall inform the Controller in a timely manner of any intended change with respect to the use or replacement of other subcontractors. The Controller may object to the change within thirty (30) days if there is a valid reason. The objection must be in writing, specifying the reasons for the objection. Any further outsourcing by the subcontractor requires the express consent of the Controller.

    The Processor must ensure that authorized subcontractors have data protection obligations fundamentally comparable to those contained in this Agreement before processing Personal Data of the Controller.

    Subcontractors are service providers whose services are directly related to the provision of the main service under the Framework Agreement and concern the processing of Data. Ancillary services, such as telecommunications services, postal or transport services, maintenance and user service, or the disposal of data carriers, are excluded from this definition.

    The Processor is obliged to take appropriate and legally compliant contractual agreements and control measures to ensure that the Data of the Controller is protected, even in the case of outsourced ancillary services. The Processor or its subcontractors process the Data in Sweden unless otherwise agreed. Processing of Data outside the EU and Sweden requires the Processor to ensure that the conditions for transferring the data to third countries in accordance with the DPA are met. The Processor shall provide proof of compliance upon request.

1. **Data and Personal Locations**

    Employees of the Processor may process the Data from personal locations as part of distant or hybrid work conditions, subject to appropriate measures being in place. The Controller authorizes the processing of such Data only, if necessary, Data protection and data security measures are in place.
